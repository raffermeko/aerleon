    """Generates a list of all nodes in a network definition.

    This method basically processes all the configuration which is
    hierarchically below "networks" in the "definitions" section in the
    configuration file to generate a list of all nodes in that definition.

    Args:
      config: YAML configuration structure (dictionaries, lists and strings)
        representing the "networks" section in "definitions" of the
        configuration file.
      unused_global_config: YAML configuration structure (dictionaries, lists
        and strings) representing the "global" section of the configuration
        file.

    Returns:
      Tuples of IPNetwork objects and string comments representing all the nodes
      in one definition.

    Raises:
      DefinateConfigError: The configuration is not well formed.
      DnsGeneratorError: There is a problem generating the output.
